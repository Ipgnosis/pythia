# Pythia*

A work in progress...

Repackaging data for matplotlib seems to take as much work as the actual analysis. I am going to try to build a wrapper around matplotlib to cut down on the work.

OR... maybe just use Seaborn...

\* Why 'Pythia'?  In Greek mythology, Pythia was the Oracle of Delphi and her name was derived from Python (which was actually a dragon) slain by Apollo.
