# Pythia*

A work in progress...

Repackaging data for matplotlib seems to take as much work as the actual analysis. I am going to try to build a wrapper around matplotlib to cut down on the work.


* Why 'pythia'?  In Greek mythology, Pythia was the Oracle of Delphi and her name was derived from python (the snake) which appears to have a role in the legend.
